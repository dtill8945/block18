Unit Tests:

    1. A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.

        Giving the function any input that is not a number will return with an error "Incorrect input"
        Giving the function two numbers (positive or negative) should multiply them together and return that calculation
        Giving the function no numbers/inputs in should return with nothing
        Giving the function only one number should return that one input

    2. A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays. 

        Giving the function two arrays of integers should return one array with only odd numbers in ascending order
        Giving the function one array of integers should return all odd numbers contained in the parent array in ascending order
        Giving the function no arrays should return with nothing
        Giving the function anything other than an array containing integers should return with an error "Incorrect input"
        Giving the function arrays containing multiple of the same odd number should only return that number once in the child array
